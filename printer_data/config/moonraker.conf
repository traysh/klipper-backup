[power device_name]
type: homeassistant
#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
#   tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
#   smartthings, mqtt, hue, http or uhubctl.
#   This parameter must be provided.
# initial_state: off
#    The state the power device should be initialized to.  May be on or
#    off.  When this option is not specified no initial state will be set.
# off_when_shutdown: False
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
# off_when_shutdown_delay: 0
#   If "off_when_shutdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
#   (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.
on_when_job_queued: True
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: False
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
#   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
#   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.
restart_delay: 1.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
# bound_services:
#   A newline separated list of services that are "bound" to the state of this
#   device.  When the device is powered on all bound services will be started.
#   When the device is powered off all bound services are stopped.
#
#   The items in this list are limited to those specified in the allow list,
#   see the [machine] configuration documentation for details.  Additionally,
#   the Moonraker service can not be bound to a power device.  Note that
#   service names are case sensitive.
#
#   When the "initial_state" option is explicitly configured bound services
#   will be synced with the current state.  For example, if the initial_state
#   is "off", all bound services will be stopped after device initialization.
#
#   The default is no services are bound to the device.
restrict_action_processing: True
#   When set to True, this option will skip "action" processing when Moonraker
#   detects a change in state triggered by an external source (ie: toggled
#   by pressing a switch on the device or through another application).  Actions
#   are post trigger events, such as restarting Klippy and controlling a bound
#   service. When set to False actions are processed for all detected changes in
#   state.  Note that Moonraker can only detect external changes for devices
#   that receive asynchronous updates (Klipper and MQTT) or devices that support
#   polling and have the 'poll_interval' option set. The default is True.

[mqtt]
address: rpi5
#   Address of the Broker.  This may be a hostname or IP Address.  This
#   parameter must be provided.
port: 1883
#   Port the Broker is listening on.  Default is 1883.
# client_id:
#   A string client identifier sent by the client to the broker after
#   connecting.  The default is a randomly assigned client id.
enable_tls: False
#   Enables SSL/TLS connections when set to true.  Note that if a user intends
#   to connect to a local MQTT service using a self signed certificate then
#   it will be necessary to install the root CA certificate on the machine
#   hosting Moonraker.  Default is False.
# username:
#   An optional username used to log in to the Broker.  This option accepts
#   Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details. The default is
#   no username (an anonymous login will be attempted).
# password:
#   An optional password used to log in to the Broker.  This option accepts
#   Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details.  The default is
#   no password.
# password_file:
#   *** DEPRECATED - Use the "password" option ***
#   An optional path to a text file containing a password used to log in
#   to the broker.  It is strongly recommended that this file be located
#   in a folder not served by Moonraker.  It is also recommended that the
#   password be unique and not used for other logins, as it is stored in
#   plain text.  To create a password file, one may ssh in to the device
#   and enter the following commands:
#      cd ~
#      echo mypassword > .mqttpass
#   Then set this option to:
#     ~/.mqttpass
#   If this option is omitted no password will be used to login.
mqtt_protocol: v3.1.1
#   The protocol to use when connecting to the Broker.  May be v3.1,
#   v3.1.1, and v5.  The default is v3.1.1
enable_moonraker_api: False
#   If set to true the MQTT client will subscribe to API topic, ie:
#     {instance_name}/moonraker/api/request
#   This can be set to False if the user does not wish to allow API
#   requests over MQTT.  The default is True.
# instance_name:
#   An identifier used to create unique API topics for each instance of
#   Moonraker on network.  This name cannot contain wildcards (+ or #).
#   For example, if the instance name is set to my_printer, Moonraker
#   will subscribe to the following topic for API requests:
#     my_printer/moonraker/api/request
#   Responses will be published to the following topic:
#     my_printer/moonraker/api/response
#   The default is the machine's hostname.
# status_objects:
#   A newline separated list of Klipper objects whose state will be
#   published.  There are two different ways to publish the states - you
#   can use either or both depending on your need.  See the
#   "publish_split_status" options for details.
#
#   For example, this option could be set as follows:
#
#     status_objects:
#       webhooks
#       toolhead=position,print_time,homed_axes
#       extruder=temperature
#
#   In the example above, all fields of the "webhooks" object will be tracked
#   and changes will be published.  Only the "position", "print_time", and
#   "homed_axes" fields of the "toolhead" will be tracked.  Likewise, only the
#   "temperature" field of the extruder will be tracked. See the
#   "Printer Objects" section of the documentation for an overview of the most
#   common objects available.
#
#   Note that Klipper will only push an update to an object/field if the field
#   has changed.  An object with no fields that have changed will not be part
#   of the payload.  Object state is checked and published roughly every 250 ms.
#
#   If not configured then no objects will be tracked and published to
#   the klipper/status topic.
# status_interval:
#   The interval (in seconds) between published status updates.  This value
#   can be used to limit the rate of updates published.  By default Moonraker
#   will publish Klipper status updates as it receives them.
# publish_split_status: False
#   Configures how to publish status updates to MQTT.
#
#   When set to False (default), all Klipper object state updates will be
#   published to a single mqtt state with the following topic:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/status
#
#   When set to True, all Klipper object state updates will be published to
#   separate mqtt topics derived from the object and item in the following
#   format:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/state/{objectname}/{statename}
#
#   The actual value of the state is published as "value" to the topic above.
#   For example, if the heater_bed temperature was 24.0, this is the payload:
#     {"eventtime": {timestamp}, "value": 24.0}
#   It would be published to this topic:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/state/heater_bed/temperature
default_qos: 0
#   The default QOS level used when publishing or subscribing to topics.
#   Must be an integer value from 0 to 2.  The default is 0.
# api_qos:
#   The QOS level to use for the API topics. If not provided, the
#   value specified by "default_qos" will be used.
